# Droppy - Interactive Weather Visualization

Droppy is an interactive weather visualization tool that displays dynamic weather data along with visual elements such as snow, rain and the position of the sun based on time, using WebGL. It allows users to input a location URL, fetch weather data, and view it with real-time rendering on a 3D canvas, if it's daytime, raining, having a bright blue sky and so on. For the moment I can only do the research using URLs from this website [The Weather Channel](https://weather.com/) but the goal will be to be able to use an API so that the user doesn't have to copy the URL himself. 

## Features

- **Dynamic Weather Visualization**: View 3D weather elements like snow, rain and bright light based on real-time data.
- **Real-Time Data Fetching**: Fetch weather details like location, temperature, and time based on user input.
- **Interactive Canvas**: A 3D rendered canvas that simulates a weather environment and visual effects such as snow, temperature-based lighting, and time transitions.
- **Dynamic Sun Position Visualization**: You can witness the sun rising and setting and be in it's accurate position for whatever city you choose.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Handles the logic for weather data fetching and canvas rendering.
- **WebGL/Shader Programming**: Used to create the 3D canvas visualization.
